# Playlist Recommendation System

## Overview
The Playlist Recommendation System aims to predict and suggest songs to complete partial playlists. By leveraging historical data from existing playlists, the system generates song recommendations that closely align with the user's preferences.

### Example Inputs and Outputs:
#### Input:
- Partial Playlist: [Imagine (John Lennon), Let it Be (The Beatles)]
#### Output:
- Recommended Songs: [Blackbird (The Beatles), Hallelujah (Jeff Buckley)]

#### Input:
- Partial Playlist: [Stronger (Kanye West), Eye of the Tiger (Survivor)]
#### Output:
- Recommended Songs: [Lose Yourself (Eminem), Can’t Hold Us (Macklemore)]

## Dataset
The project utilizes the **Spotify Million Playlist Dataset (MPD)**, which comprises 1,000,000 playlists generated by real users. Each playlist includes:
- Playlist Title
- Tracks (including artist, title, and unique track ID)
- Number of Tracks in the Playlist
- Associated User (anonymized)

### Dataset Access
1. Download the dataset from [Kaggle’s Spotify Million Playlist Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com).
2. Save the dataset in a directory (e.g., Google Drive).
3. Use tools like `gdown` to automate the downloading process if necessary.

## Objectives
The primary objective is to predict songs that users are likely to add to an incomplete playlist based on historical data. This involves:
- Understanding playlist patterns.
- Building a recommendation model.
- Evaluating the model's performance using standard metrics.

## Evaluation Metrics
To assess the quality of recommendations, we use the following metrics:

### Precision@k
Measures the percentage of recommended tracks that are actually part of the original playlist.
\[
Precision@k = \frac{\text{Number of correct tracks in the top } k \text{ positions}}{k}
\]

### Recall@k
Measures the percentage of tracks from the original playlist that were successfully retrieved.
\[
Recall@k = \frac{\text{Number of correct tracks retrieved}}{\text{Total number of tracks in the original playlist}}
\]

### Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)
Evaluates the rank of the first correct track in the recommendations.
\[
MRR = \frac{1}{\text{Position of the first correct track}}
\]

## Project Steps
### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Load and explore the dataset.
- Clean and structure data to prepare for modeling.
- Handle missing or duplicate values if any.

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Extract useful features from the dataset, such as:
  - Track popularity.
  - Playlist context (e.g., genre, mood, title keywords).
  - User listening patterns.

### 3. Model Development
- Implement recommendation algorithms:
  - **Collaborative Filtering**: Using user and playlist similarities.
  - **Content-Based Filtering**: Analyzing track metadata and playlist context.
  - **Hybrid Approaches**: Combining collaborative and content-based methods.

### 4. Evaluation and Optimization
- Test models using validation sets.
- Optimize recommendations based on Precision@k, Recall@k, and MRR.
- Fine-tune hyperparameters for better performance.

### 5. Deployment
- Package the model into a deployable format.
- Optionally create an interface for real-time recommendations.
